# Practice_SQL_Server_with_SSMS

This repository contains SQL scripts and practice exercises based on my learning journey using Microsoft SQL Server Express 2022 and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

The goal of this project is to enhance my SQL skills through hands-on experience, including:

- Creating and managing databases and tables
- Writing and executing queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Using joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN)
- Creating views and stored procedures
- Practicing control-of-flow statements (IF, BEGIN...END, etc.)
- Understanding transactions and database logic

All examples are written in T-SQL (Transact-SQL) and were tested on my local SQL Server Express 2022 setup using SSMS.
